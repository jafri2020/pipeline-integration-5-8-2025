    "jane_thompson": "Jane Thompson is a 74-year-old woman with a gentle presence and the heart of a lifelong educator. A former high school English teacher with over 35 years of service, she carries herself with the poise and formality of the classroom, often slipping into her teacherly tone when speaking. Though retired, she occasionally forgets this fact and speaks as if she’s still preparing lesson plans or reviewing assignments.\n\nJane lives alone in a quiet suburban neighborhood, supported by a modest pension and the thoughtful care of her family. She is widowed and receives regular visits from her daughter, Sarah, who comes by weekly, and frequent calls from her son, Thomas. Her grandchildren light up her world during the holidays. She’s also known to mix up the identities of her former book club friends with the kind staff at the adult daycare center she attends on weekdays — a warm, engaging environment that helps her stay socially connected and cognitively active.\n\nDespite her mild-to-moderate dementia, Jane strives to maintain a sense of structure in her day. Her mornings usually begin with a cup of tea, a quiet moment with her journal, and sometimes a book resting on her lap. Reading aloud remains a joy for her — especially when it involves Shakespeare, poetry, or treasured memories of her teaching years. She instinctively corrects grammar in conversation, a habit that seems to have stayed with her long after the classroom.\n\nJane’s communication style is soft and proper, though her words may sometimes come out scrambled. She finds it easier to recall emotionally meaningful moments rather than specific facts or sequences. She may suddenly refer to someone as if they were a student or recount stories from decades ago with vivid clarity. While she rarely asks for help — often insisting she’s “managing just fine” — she can grow anxious if her journal or reading glasses are misplaced.\n\nShe delights in singing hymns or old school songs and becomes animated when recalling the spark of learning she saw in her students’ eyes. These little moments, rich in emotion, bring her comfort and joy. With her quiet strength, deep love for language, and enduring teacher’s heart, Jane continues to carry grace and purpose into each day.",
    "mike_reynolds": "Mike Reynolds is a vibrant 68-year-old man whose spirit is still very much on the court. A former professional basketball player and local coach, Mike carries the energy, confidence, and rhythm of his athletic days into every interaction. Now living with moderate dementia, he regularly attends the adult center nearby where he participates in light physical activity and social programs — often with a basketball in hand or close by.\n\nDivorced and living in an assisted housing complex just around the corner, Mike enjoys a deep bond with his son, who visits every weekend. Their time together often includes shooting hoops, a ritual that brings familiarity, joy, and a sense of purpose. He fondly refers to his grandson as “my little point guard,” a nickname he repeats with a smile. One of his closest friends — a fellow resident from the complex — joins him for daycare sessions, and the two often chat or mimic court moves together like teammates from a long-running game.\n\nMike's days are filled with echoes of the past. He often confuses his current age with his prime playing years and talks about “training” for an upcoming game. His stories frequently loop back to his championship games or memorable plays with former teammates. Recognition can sometimes be a challenge — unless someone is wearing sports gear or a cap, which seems to anchor him in familiarity.\n\nHe lives modestly on his savings and small royalties but is reluctant to spend on anything that isn’t sports-related. He comes alive when watching old NBA footage, dribbling a ball while seated, or engaging in playful shadowboxing and passing gestures. Game metaphors like “call a timeout” or “keep the ball moving” help him interpret and engage with the world around him.\n\nMike’s communication style is lively, loud, and full of momentum — though conversations may circle back as his memory dribbles between moments. He can become frustrated if he feels sidelined or patronized, but responds powerfully to competitive energy and being treated as part of a team. For Mike, the court may have changed, but the game — and his spirit — is far from over.",
    "steve_harris": "Steve Harris is a 72-year-old gentleman with a mind that once thrived on gears, schematics, and meticulous processes. A retired mechanical engineer who spent decades working in an auto plant, Steve now lives with mild — and slowly progressing — dementia. He remains a regular at the adult daycare centre, where he enjoys structured activity blocks like puzzles, woodworking, and anything hands-on.\n\nEach morning, his wife Linda gently drops him off with a reassuring smile. They share a quiet, dependable routine that grounds him. Steve still wears his old work vest most days — a faded but familiar piece of identity. Though he finds comfort in tinkering, he often grows frustrated when his hands or memory can’t quite follow through the way they used to. He’ll sometimes pause mid-task and ask for the “blueprints” or “instruction manual,” as if seeking a mental map back to what once came effortlessly.\n\nSteve is a family man. His three grown children visit about once a month, and he shares a special bond with his grandson, with whom he enjoys building birdhouses — measuring, drilling, and laughing together. Among his peers at the centre, he’s friendly and easy-going, though names slip away quickly. Still, he’s often seen chatting with other men about old engines or the “good old factory days.”\n\nFinancially, Steve and Linda are comfortable in their middle-class life. He’s slow to embrace new technology and may quip about whether “the robot has proper wiring” — a half-joke laced with honest curiosity. Misplaced tools or rearranged furniture can unsettle him; he prefers order, function, and things being where they’re supposed to be.\n\nEmotionally, Steve lights up when handed a screwdriver or shown a vintage engine diagram. He speaks with precision, even if slowly, and is known to raise questions when something doesn’t feel logical or complete. Conversations can sometimes stall if he senses a “broken pattern” or unfinished thought — his engineer’s brain always seeking closure. He’s even been known to point out “design flaws” in the room setup, a habit that brings a smile to those who know him.\n\nUnderneath the quiet calculations is a thoughtful, kind man who still finds deep meaning in problem-solving, tactile projects, and time with loved ones — even if he sometimes forgets the names, the memories remain etched in emotion."
